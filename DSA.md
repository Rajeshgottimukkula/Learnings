4 - Why Data structures and algorithms are important


#### Understanding and Refining:
- Performing operations on data involves taking input, processing it, and providing output.
- Optimization of these steps is crucial for efficiency, especially in the processing step where data structures and algorithms play a vital role.

#### What is it?
- Data structures and algorithms are fundamental tools for organizing and processing data in software development.

#### Why it is used?
- Used to optimize the processing step, enhancing efficiency in tasks like finding the shortest path in Google Maps.
- Efficient data organization (data structures) impacts performance.

#### How it is used?
- Examples include using graph data structures and algorithms like Dijkstra's for efficient pathfinding.
- Properly organized data structures enable quick and efficient processing.

#### Example (Technical):
- Google Maps utilizes algorithms like Dijkstra's for efficient pathfinding.

#### Example (Real World):
- Analogous to organizing books in a library, where data structures (arrangement of books) and algorithms (finding a book) are essential.

5- Types of Data structures



#### Understanding and Refining:
- Data structures are broadly categorized into primitive and non-primitive types.
- Primitive data structures are predefined in programming languages, including integer, float, character, and boolean.
- Non-primitive data structures are user-defined and can be linear (static or dynamic) or non-linear.

#### What is it?
- Primitive data structures are inherent in programming languages, while non-primitive structures are user-defined combinations of primitive ones.

#### Why it is used?
- Different data structures serve unique purposes based on their properties, optimizing efficiency in specific scenarios.

#### How it is used?
- Examples include arrays (static linear), linked lists, stacks, and queues (dynamic linear), as well as graph and tree data structures (non-linear).

#### Example (Technical):
- Dynamic data structures like linked lists adapt to changing memory locations.

#### Example (Real World):
- Graph data structures work well for maps, while stack structures are ideal for implementing backward and forward buttons.

#### Mnemonic:
- PNU (Primitive, Non-primitive, Usage)
