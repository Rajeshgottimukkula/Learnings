# Introduction to Microservices with Spring Boot


### Course Structure
1. **Spring Boot Fundamentals**
    - Starting with the basics of Spring Boot.
    - Creating Spring Boot projects.
    - Developing different APIs and REST endpoints.

2. **Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA**
    - Exploring Spring Boot and its integration with Spring Data JPA.
    - Creating REST APIs and connecting them to the backend database.

3. **Introduction to Web Services**
    - Understanding the basics of web services.

4. **Microservices Architecture**
    - Defining microservices, exploring their advantages and disadvantages.
    - Creating a microservices architecture with multiple interconnected microservices.
    - Utilizing Spring Cloud components to implement microservices.

5. **Containerization with Docker**
    - Learning Docker to convert applications into containerized format.
    - Deploying applications using Docker containers.

6. **Orchestrating with Kubernetes**
    - Understanding Kubernetes for orchestrating containers.
    - Deploying microservices architecture into a Kubernetes cluster.

7. **Automated Pipeline**
    - Implementing an automated pipeline for deploying microservices.


## Real-world Analogy
Think of microservices as specialized workers in a factory. Each worker (microservice) has a specific task, and they collaborate seamlessly to achieve the overall production goal.

## Mnemonic
Remember the course agenda with the acronym "SWIM-CDP": Spring Boot, Web services, Microservices, Containerization (Docker), Kubernetes, Deploying (Automated Pipeline).

## Review Questions
1. What are the fundamental topics covered in the Spring Boot section?
2. How does microservices architecture differ from monolithic architecture?
3. Why is Docker used for containerization?

## Summary
This course provides a comprehensive journey from Spring Boot basics to deploying microservices using advanced technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Embrace the full spectrum of building, orchestrating, and deploying microservices.
