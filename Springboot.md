### 2. **What is spring boot:**

#### Understanding and Refining:
- Spring Boot simplifies development over the Spring framework by handling configurations automatically.
- Originally, Spring framework involved complex XML configurations, posing challenges for developers.
- Spring Boot streamlines configurations, eliminating the need for extensive manual setup, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

#### What is it?
- Spring Boot simplifies Spring framework development by automating configurations, freeing developers from manual XML setup complexities.

#### Why it is used?
- Used to reduce complexity in Spring framework development by automating configurations, enabling developers to concentrate on business logic.

#### How it is used?
- Developers benefit from Spring Boot's automatic handling of configurations, avoiding the manual setup hassle prevalent in the Spring framework.

#### Example (Technical):
- Spring Boot abstracts complexities, replacing extensive XML configurations, offering a more developer-friendly environment focused on business logic.

#### Example (Real World):
- Imagine Spring Boot as a helpful assistant that tidies up your workspace, so you don't need to dive into complicated configurations. You can jump straight into crafting your business logic.

#### Mnemonic:
- ABCD (Abstraction, Business Logic, Configurations, Developers)

## 3. Dependency Injection 

### Understanding and Refining:
Dependency Injection in Spring simplifies managing dependencies in object-oriented programming. In scenarios like a "Student" class with fields (first name, last name, email ID), manual object creation leads to explicit dependencies. For example, "Student" may depend on "Subject," causing challenges in memory management and garbage collection.

### What is it?
Dependency Injection in Spring addresses managing dependencies in object-oriented programming by automatically handling object creation.

### Why it is used?
It simplifies development by handling configurations, reducing manual setup, and minimizing potential memory issues.

### How it is used?
Developers define dependencies in a class, and Spring injects the required objects during runtime, improving flexibility and easing maintenance.

### Example (Technical):
```java
// Before Dependency Injection
public class Student {
    private Subject subject;

    public Student() {
        this.subject = new Subject();
    }
}

// After Dependency Injection
public class Student {
    private Subject subject;

    public Student(Subject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
    }
}
```

### Example (Real World):
Imagine preparing a meal where each ingredient represents a class. Dependency Injection is like having the ingredients delivered to your kitchen, reducing the need to go to the store each time.

### Mnemonic:
Think of Dependency Injection as a "delivery service" for classes, making development smoother.
