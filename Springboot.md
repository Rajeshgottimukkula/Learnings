2- What is spring boot

### 1. **Your Understanding:**

#### Understanding and Refining:
- Spring Boot simplifies development over the Spring framework by handling configurations automatically.
- Originally, Spring framework involved complex XML configurations, posing challenges for developers.
- Spring Boot streamlines configurations, eliminating the need for extensive manual setup, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

#### What is it?
- Spring Boot simplifies Spring framework development by automating configurations, freeing developers from manual XML setup complexities.

#### Why it is used?
- Used to reduce complexity in Spring framework development by automating configurations, enabling developers to concentrate on business logic.

#### How it is used?
- Developers benefit from Spring Boot's automatic handling of configurations, avoiding the manual setup hassle prevalent in the Spring framework.

#### Example (Technical):
- Spring Boot abstracts complexities, replacing extensive XML configurations, offering a more developer-friendly environment focused on business logic.

#### Example (Real World):
- Imagine Spring Boot as a helpful assistant that tidies up your workspace, so you don't need to dive into complicated configurations. You can jump straight into crafting your business logic.

#### Mnemonic:
- ABCD (Abstraction, Business Logic, Configurations, Developers)
