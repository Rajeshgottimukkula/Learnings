### 1. Your Understanding:

#### Understanding and Refining:
Incorporating initial insights into GitOps and refining for clarity within a broader context.

#### What is it?
GitOps utilizes Git as a single source of truth, managing applications and infrastructure through versioned, declarative manifests.

#### Why it is used?
GitOps addresses the challenge of tracking changes in Kubernetes deployments, providing versioning, auditing, and automation for both applications and infrastructure.

#### How it is used?
Practical implementation involves leveraging Git repositories for declarative YAML manifests and GitOps controllers (e.g., Argo CD) to automatically deploy changes to Kubernetes.

#### Example (Technical):
Submitting a pull request to modify a Kubernetes YAML manifest in a Git repository, which, once approved, triggers the GitOps controller for deployment.

#### Example (Real World):
Similar to tracking changes in source code, GitOps ensures a versioned and auditable history for managing and deploying changes to Kubernetes clusters.

#### Mnemonic:
VDA-C: Versioned, Declarative, Automatic Pulls, Continuous Reconciliation.
